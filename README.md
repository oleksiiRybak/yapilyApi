Hi,
I'd like to add a few notes so that you can understand my approach to this task.
I am aware that the name of the that JSON with charactersID sometimes not the correct name, 
this is something that needs to be fixed but I decided to stop at this moment for the time limitations.
Also, I've applied a few tests and decided to stop at this moment (again, for the time limitations)
but in a real-life scenario this wouldn't be enough and more test coverage would be required.

I hope you like my solution.

Thanks, 
Oleksii
